# Git Commands

Makes git add all files to its watchlist. Adds current version to inclusion. "." tells it to watch everything, but you can specifiy a file instead "index.html"

# git commit -m "Message"
Adds whatever was worked on to the master branch, and uploads it

## when do you commit?

Commit whenever you get something working, commit then 

# git push
Pushes code to github

# git clone
If the repository starts on Github, it will pull it down onto your local machine. Only will need to clone once

# git pull 
Downloads freshest version of repo

#git status
Diagnostic, Incredibly useful

## Good git rule:
Pull first, then push your changes. 
Pull often!!!
