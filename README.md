CBC notes 

### This is my Readme file

# Terminal Commands:

### cd < some directory >
Change Directory. This changes the current working directory. Working directory is the file path you are currently on in your terminal

< some directory > can be any folder on your system. 

if it isn't there, it will give you this error: 

`-bash: cd: Documents: No such file or directory 
`

### ls < some directory >
Lists all the files and directories in the current path or on the path designated

### pwd
Present Working Directory. Shows the current file path from root to current file

### mkdir
Makes a new directory. 

### touch < some file name >
Creates a file with the name of < some file name >

### rm < some file name >
Deletes a file, no take backs. 

### rmdir < directory >
Removes a directory, no take backs.

### cp < file > < location >

this copies file

### mv < file > < location >

moves file

# Git Commands

# git add .
Makes git add all files to its watchlist. Adds current version to inclusion. "." tells it to watch everything, but you can specifiy a file instead "index.html"

# git commit -m "Message"
Adds whatever was worked on to the master branch, and uploads it

## when do you commit?

Commit whenever you get something working, commit then 

# git push
Pushes code to github

# git clone
If the repository starts on Github, it will pull it down onto your local machine. Only will need to clone once

# git pull 
Downloads freshest version of repo

#git status
Diagnostic, Incredibly useful

## Good git rule:
Pull first, then push your changes. 
Pull often!!!

Git Kraken: GUI that shows the difference between versions (you can also do this on GitHub itself)

Gitlab is another Git hub like website, Github and Gitlab are very simialir though you may have private things on gitlab cheaper

# Cool Terminal Shortcuts

## upkey
Goes to the last command

## tab key (while typing a file name)
Autofills if it is unique

## special directories

~/ user directory

../ one directory up aka parent directory

./ current directory 

/ root directory

### HTML 

Section  tag vs Div tag

essentially the same thing accept for accessability 

# General Tips of Class

20 hours a week outside of class

Roughly broken down 8 hours independent study

12 hours on homework

# CSS Notes 5/5/2018

### Class

notated with a "." so it looks like .classItem

Class is a series of elements of which multiple can be on single page

### ID

notated with a "#" so it looks like #IDitem

ID is individual items, one per page

IF element has a ID and a Class, ID > class

# Relative File Paths

connect us with other files in our working directory

Everything, is like, relative, man. So be careful with file paths. 

../../ etc goes up multiple folder levles

# Box Model

Content, padding, border, margin

padding { top, right, bottom, left} Thinkg of it as trouble: Top Right Bottom Left ()

# Floats

default, every HTML elemented displayed in browser is governed by flow (think wrap-text options)

This means html elements FORCE their adjacent elements

block elements vs inline elements

Floats probably need to be cleared, using the "clearfix hack" 

```
.clearfix::after {
    content:"";
    display: block;
    clear: both;
}
```


Layering with Z INdex

Z-Index allows you to laywer elements, 
css:
z-index:2; vs z-index: 1; (the larger the value the closer to YOU (if you think of depth on a browser))


# 5/8/2018 Notes

Homework will be due 5/12/2018
it sounds like I will only be submitting 1 of the 2 projects, so probably the harder of the two and I can stop worrying about the first project

Watch some videos about working with git in a team setting (only have used it for personal use previously, this could be a distraction if the concepts of team git)

## Full Stack

Everything from the front end to the back end 

## CSS Positioning

### Position: fixed 
Not going to move (could use this on the HW footer)
### Position: relative
It is based on the closest parent element that specifies a position (whatever container)
### position: absolute 
A bit unclear concerning how this is different from fixed
### position: static
Falls wherever it falls on the page

Check out Smashing  Magazine News Letter

Remember that last stylesheet is the most impactful (kinda?)

## Some Other Stuff

Section vs Div
Section and article express more intent (they are semantic) but they are also containers just like div

### HTML 5 Semantic elements

...they are pretty much divs with better intent expressed through their usage EG, Header, Footer, Article, Aside, Details, Summary, etc

But a lot of places still use div instead of these semantics tags

### Chrome Dev Tools
It rocks. It is super useful. Use it all the time. You can step through javascript, you can see what file and line is causing issues. You can edit CSS in the browser.

CTRL + SHIFT + I is the short cut


## ajax

Asychonrous javascript in XML
Requests to a server to get data back
In the network tab

## Battle of the browsers

Webpages can render differently browser to browser

CSS reset (https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) this makes a "standard" of sorts to do things across the browsers, wipes out all the stupid inherent special styling within each browser

Apply the Reset.css first and then apply your css. Most frameworks have something like this built in.

CSS reset is important for creating browser-compatible websites, levels the playing field. THIS IS A COMMON FRONT END INTERVIEW QUESTION

# Deploying code to Github

Github provides hosting for static websites

https://epicureanheron.github.io/

Apparenlty I can hose a project using the github.io page I have. I am a big vague on details, but I am tired.

# 5/10/2018 Notes

Overview: CSS Typography and Google Fonts, Pseudo-Classes, Twitter Bootstrap

## CSS Typography

line height should be 1.5 x the font

font size-actually size. 16px is the min

Line length, not a css property, 50-75 charagers per line on a desktop

Letter spacing

sans-serif vs serif, sans-serif doesn't have the serifs (tails and crap)

## Google Fonts

Really awesome, open source fonts https://fonts.google.com/

also check out https://fontawesome.com/get-started for open source image thingies

## Psuedo Classes

Css has keywords that can be added to selectors. These highlight the special states of the selected elements

```
a:active { 
    background-color: black
}
```

I could add this to the homework

: for psuedo class
:: for psuedo element

## Bootstrap

It is super nice. Can just link to the bootstrap stuff out there. 

Bootstrap apparenlty built by Twitter. That's cool.
