# Git Commands

# git add .
Makes git add all files to its watchlist. Adds current version to inclusion. "." tells it to watch everything, but you can specifiy a file instead "index.html"

# git commit -m "Message"
Adds whatever was worked on to the master branch, and uploads it

## when do you commit?

Commit whenever you get something working, commit then 

# git push
Pushes code to github

# git clone
If the repository starts on Github, it will pull it down onto your local machine. Only will need to clone once

# git pull 
Downloads freshest version of repo

#git status
Diagnostic, Incredibly useful

## Good git rule:
Pull first, then push your changes. 
Pull often!!!

Git Kraken: GUI that shows the difference between versions (you can also do this on GitHub itself)

Gitlab is another Git hub like website, Github and Gitlab are very simialir though you may have private things on gitlab cheaper
